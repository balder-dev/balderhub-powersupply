Introduction into Powersupply
*****************************

Programmable power supplies (PPS) are advanced electronic devices designed to deliver precise, adjustable electrical
power to a load or circuit under test. Unlike traditional fixed-output power supplies, PPS units allow users to
dynamically control parameters such as voltage, current, and power limits through software interfaces or remote
commands, making them essential tools in automated testing, research, and development environments.

Core Functionality
==================

At their core, programmable power supplies convert input AC or DC power into a regulated output that can be finely
tuned. Key functional aspects include:

* **Voltage and Current Programming**: Users can set specific output levels (e.g., 0-60V DC at up to 10A) via digital
  interfaces like USB, LAN, GPIB, or RS-232. Many support Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI)
  for standardized control.
* **Modes of Operation**: Common modes include constant voltage (CV), constant current (CC), and constant power (CP),
  with automatic crossover between modes to maintain stability.
* **Measurement and Monitoring**: Built-in meters provide real-time feedback on output voltage, current, and power,
  often with high precision (e.g., 0.01% accuracy). Some models include data logging or waveform generation for
  simulating dynamic conditions.
* **Protection Features**: Over-voltage protection (OVP), over-current protection (OCP), and thermal shutdown safeguard
  both the supply and connected devices from damage.
* **Remote Control and Automation**: Integration with software tools enables scripted
  sequences, such as ramping voltage for stress testing or integrating into larger test benches.

Applications and Benefits
=========================

PPS devices are widely used in electronics prototyping, battery simulation, semiconductor testing, and automated
manufacturing. Their programmability enhances efficiency by reducing manual adjustments, improving repeatability, and
enabling integration into IoT or CI/CD pipelines. Compared to non-programmable supplies, they offer greater
flexibility, scalability, and cost savings in high-volume or complex scenarios.
